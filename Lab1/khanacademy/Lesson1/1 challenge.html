    <h1>Waves of Time</h1>
    <p>
        The waves of time crash upon the shore,<br>
        Whispering tales of what came before.<br>
        Each ripple carries a fleeting dream,<br>
        Echoes of laughter, a silent scream.<br>
        <br>
        The sand remembers each fleeting trace,<br>
        Footprints of those who embraced the chase.<br>
        Time flows on, an eternal stream,<br>
        A fleeting shadow, a golden gleam.
